## Testing

In order to manually test the flow, you can do the following:

1. Register an app in `https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/consent`
2. Generate clientId and clientSecret credentials in the console
3. Replace the values in the test with your credentials
4. Remove the `server.listen()` call
5. Run the tests, get the `location` value from the `authenticate` test, open the browser
6. Once redirected, copy the `code` param from the URL, and add it in one of the `callback` success tests
7. Once you run the tests, you should get back an access token, id token, and so on.
