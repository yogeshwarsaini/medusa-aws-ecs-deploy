     *
     * @param query - Filters and pagination configurations.
     * @param headers - Headers to pass in the request.
     * @returns The paginated list of exchanges.
     *
     * @example
     * To retrieve the list of exchanges:

     * ```ts
     * sdk.admin.exchange.list()
     * .then(({ exchanges, count, limit, offset }) => {
     *   console.log(exchanges)
     * })
     * ```
     *
     * To configure the pagination, pass the `limit` and `offset` query parameters.
     *
     * For example, to retrieve only 10 items and skip 10 items:
     *
     * ```ts
     * sdk.admin.exchange.list({
     *   limit: 10,
     *   offset: 10
     * })
     * .then(({ exchanges, count, limit, offset }) => {
     *   console.log(exchanges)
     * })
     * ```
     *
     * Using the `fields` query parameter, you can specify the fields and relations to retrieve
     * in each exchange:
     *
     * ```ts
     * sdk.admin.exchange.list({
