# Payment Module

A Payment is the result of a series of financial transactions performed as part of collecting a payment of a purchase. The Payment holds information about the payment provider as well as the state of it. You can associate a Payment with a Cart, an Order, an OrderEdit, or any other resource youâ€™d like to have your customers pay for.
